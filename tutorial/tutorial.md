### Basic setup
We are going to create our custom shaders based on this shader [Cube lines Shader]. First we need to generate our rays. For this we need to have a ray origin( `ro` ), which is going to be our camera's position, and a ray direction( `rd` ), which we are going to calculate ourselves. The idea is to generate them in simple to calculate coordinates, and then to rotate them to match the view direction and orientation of the camera.  

We are going to place our origin at ( 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 ) and shoot rays in +Z direction. The X and Y coordinates will be decided from the fragment posiiton on the screen:

```glsl
vec3 rd = vec3( ( fragCoord * 2.0 - iResolution.xy ) / iResolution.x, 0.7 );
```

We shift a fragment position to be centered at the  origin( [ 0.0, 0.0 ]), and then we normalize them by the width of the screen. This way we are going to have uniform speed across X and Y axis, when we move our camera. Z value define FOV ofthe camera - the bigger it is, the more zoomed in the view will be. We flip the Y axis, because fragment coordinates start at left-upper corner, and we need it to start at the left-bottom corner.

Now we need to define the camera's coordinate system, whose unit vectors will define the rotation that we need to perform on our rays:

```glsl
// Orthonormal vectors of the view transformation
vec3 vz = normalize( view_dir );
vec3 vy = normalize( up );
vec3 vx = normalize( cross( vz, vy ) );
vy = normalize( cross( vx, vz ) );
mat3 m = mat3( vx, vy, vz );
```

In camera's coordinate system, Z axis will point in the `view` direction, Y axis in the `Up` direction, and X axis will be perpendicular to the Y and Z. We normalize all vectors to be sure they are `1` in length.   

Now we apply camera's rotation to our rays:

```glsl
rd = normalize( m * rd );
```

An intuitive explanation, as to how this rotation work is we assume are rays are defined in camera's local coordinate system. What we need is to find the coordinates of our rays in the world space. Orthonormal vectors, that define camera's coordinate system, are all defined in world space coordinates. So to find, for example, the X coordinate of our ray in the world space, we just need to find the contribution of each if its components( defined in camera's local space ) to the X coordinate in the world space. We multiply each component by the X value of its corresponding orthonormal vector and sum them together getting the X coordinate in the world space for our vector. Other axises are done in the same way.

Here are a few resources to help with understanding:

### Background

To draw a plane, we need to find the point of intersection between our ray and the plane. The formula can be derived analitically and translated directly to code:

```glsl
float raytrace_plane
( 
  in vec3 ro, // Ray origin
  in vec3 rd, // Ray direction
  in vec3 normal, // Normal of the plane
  in vec3 p0 // Any point on the plane
)
{
  // If this equals 0.0, then the line is parallel to the plane
  float RdotN = dot( rd, normal );
  if( RdotN == 0.0 ) { return -1.0; }

  float t = dot( ( p0 - ro ), normal ) / RdotN;
  return t;
}
```
Links:
- [Line-plane intersection]
- [Intersectors]

Then we call it like this:
```glsl
float plane_t = raytrace_plane( ro, rd, plane_normal, p0 );
```

If `plane_t` is bigger than 0.0, then we got a hit in a positive direction of our ray.
We will limit the size of our plane, by only drawing if X and Z coordinates are in certain bounds:
```glsl
vec3 draw_background
(
  in vec3 ro,
  in vec3 rd
)
{
  float plane_size = 12.0;
  vec3 plane_normal = vec3( 0.0, 1.0, 0.0 ); // Normal of the plane
  vec3 p0 = PLANE_P; // Any point on the plane

  float plane_t = raytrace_plane( ro, rd, plane_normal, p0 );

  if( plane_t > 0.0 )
  {
    vec3 plane_hit = ro + plane_t * rd;
    vec2 uv = abs( plane_hit.xz )
    if all( uv <= vec2f( plane_size ) )
    {
      // Color the plane
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

The light will be a point light, and it will have light attenuation based on the distance from the light. We will use a simple [Bling-Phong reflection model]:
```glsl
// Calculate the distance to the light source
float r = length( LIGHT_SOURCE - plane_hit );
// Attenuation of the light, that can be controlled by the `LIGHT_POWER` constant
float attenuation = LIGHT_POWER / ( r * r );

// Direction to the light source
vec3 light_dir = normalize( LIGHT_SOURCE - plane_hit );
float LdotN = saturate( dot( light_dir, plane_normal ) );
// Half vector between the view direction and the light direction
vec3 H = normalize( light_dir - rd );
// Adds a specular reflection
float phong_value = pow( saturate( dot( plane_normal, H ) ), 16.0 ) * 0.1;

// Diffuse color of the plane
vec3 diff_color = vec3( 1.0 );
// Apply lighting 
vec3 plane_color = ( LdotN * diff_color + phong_value );
// Reduce by the attenuation
plane_color *= attenuation;
```

We also will smooth out the edges of the plane, to make it look like a disk that slowly fades away:
```glsl
float plane_size = 12.0;
float blur_radius = 10.0; // New
vec3 plane_normal = vec3( 0.0, 1.0, 0.0 );

// ...

if( plane_t > 0.0 )
{
  // ...

  if( all( lessThanEqual( uv, vec2( plane_size ) ) ) )
  {
    // ...

    final_color = mix
    ( 
      plane_color, 
      final_color, 
      smoothstep
      ( 
        blur_radius - 1.5,
        blur_radius,
        length( uv )
      ) 
    );
  }
}
```

I decided to use [Gamma correction] on the background only, which is usually done for the final color of the scene. The reason for the is because the plane looks nicer, but everything else isn't:

```glsl
return pow( final_color, vec3( 1.0 / 2.2 ) );
```

To not have a pitch black backgroun, we'll take the background color function from the [Cube lines Shader]:
```glsl
vec3 bgcol( in vec3 rd )
{
  return pow(mix
  ( 
      vec3( 0.01 ), 
      vec3( 0.336, 0.458, 0.668 ), 
      1.0 - pow( abs( rd.y ), 1.3 ) 
  ), vec3( 2.0 ));
}
```

And add it to out caclulations:

```glsl
vec3 draw_background
(
  in vec3 ro,
  in vec3 rd
)
{
  vec3 final_color = vec3( 0.0 );
  float plane_size = 12.0;
  float blur_radius = 10.0;
  vec3 plane_normal = vec3( 0.0, 1.0, 0.0 ); // Normal of the plane
  vec3 p0 = PLANE_P; // Any point on the plane
  final_color = bgcol( rd ); // New

  // ...
}
```

### Box

Again we are going to use an analitically derived intersection between the ray and an axis aligned box from here [Intersectors]. The function below is slightly modified and is taken from the [Strange Crystal Shader], with a little explanation from me.
```glsl
float raytrace_box
(
  in vec3 ro, 
  in vec3 rd, 
  out vec3 normal, // Normal at the hit point
  in vec3 box_dimension,
  in bool entering
) 
{
  // Having an equation ro + t * rd, we calculate an intersection `t` with 3 planes : xy, xz, and yz.
  // we calculate `t`, such that our ray hits the planes xy, xz, yz.
  // The result for each plane is stored in z, y, x coordinates of the `t` variable respectively.
  vec3 dr = 1.0 / rd;
  vec3 t = ro * dr;
  // Now we need to offset the `t` to hit planes that build the box.
  // If we take a point in the corner of the box and calculate the distance needed to travel from that corner
  // to all three planes, we can then take that distance and subtruct/add to our `t`, to get the proper hit value.
  vec3 dt = box_dimension * abs( dr );
  
  // Planes facing us are closer, so we need to subtruct
  vec3 pin = - dt - t;
  // Planes behind the front planes are farther, so we need to add
  vec3 pout =  dt - t;

  // From the distances to all the front and back faces, we find faces of the box that are actually hit by the ray
  float tin = max( pin.x, max( pin.y, pin.z ) );
  float tout = min( pout.x, min( pout.y, pout.z ) );

  // Ray is outside of the box
  if( tin > tout )
  { 
    return -1.0;
  }

  // Calculate the normal
  if( entering )
  {
    normal = -sign( rd ) * step( pin.zxy, pin.xyz ) * step( pin.yzx, pin.xyz );
  } 
  else 
  {
    normal = sign (rd ) * step( pout.xyz, pout.zxy ) * step( pout.xyz, pout.yzx );
  }

  return entering ? tin : tout;
}
```

It's going to return the distance to the hit point from the `ro` and write the normal of the box in `normal` parameter

Back to the `main` function, we find the intersection with the box and color it if there was a hit:
```glsl
vec3 box_normal;
float box_t = raytrace_box( ro, rd, box_normal, BOX_DIMENSIONS, true );

if( box_t > 0.0 )
{
  // Nullify the color to not have a fully transparent box
  final_color = vec3( 0.0 );
  // Intersection point on the box
  vec3 ro = ro + box_t * rd;

  // Color Here
}
```

At the edges we are going to add a dark smooth stitch to cover the transition between the sides:
```glsl
const vec3 BOX_DIMENSIONS = vec3( 0.75, 1.25, 0.75 );
// Distance to the edges
const vec3 BOX_DTE = vec3
( 
  length( BOX_DIMENSIONS.xz ), 
  length( BOX_DIMENSIONS.xy ), 
  length( BOX_DIMENSIONS.yz ) 
);

/// ...

// Paint the edges in black with a little blur at transition
float smooth_box_edge( in vec3 ro )
{
  vec3 edge_blur = smoothstep
  ( 
    BOX_DTE - vec3( 0.02 ), 
    BOX_DTE, 
    vec3( length( ro.xz ), length( ro.xy ), length( ro.yz ) ) 
  );

  return max( edge_blur.x, max( edge_blur.y, edge_blur.z ) );
}
```

Box is symmetrical and is centered at the origin, so we can store the distance to the edges( three of them ) in `BOX_DTE` constant. The function then applies a smoothstep some dinstance away form the edge and towards the edge, depending on the current distance of the hit point. We then return the maximum across all three edges, to only cover the closest edge.

Add the color in the `main` function
```glsl
const vec3 BOX_EDGE_COLOR = vec3( 0.0 );
// ...

if( box_t > 0.0 )
{
  // ...
  float edge_t = smooth_box_edge( ro );
  final_color = mix( final_color, BOX_EDGE_COLOR, edge_t ) ;
}
```

If you paint the box white, you'll get this.

</p>

For the shadow we are going to use Inigo Quilez's implementation [Box - fake soft shadow Shader]( Article [Box functions] ). Copy them to our code:

```glsl
float segShadow( in vec3 ro, in vec3 rd, in vec3 pa, in float sh )
{
  float k1 = 1.0 - rd.x * rd.x;
  float k4 = ( ro.x - pa.x ) * k1;
  float k6 = ( ro.x + pa.x ) * k1;
  vec2 k5 = ro.yz * k1;
  vec2 k7 = pa.yz * k1;
  float k2 = -dot( ro.yz, rd.yz );
  vec2 k3 = pa.yz * rd.yz;
  
  for( int i = 0; i < 4; i++ )
  {
    vec2 ss = vec2( i & 1, i >> 1 ) * 2.0 - 1.0;
    float thx = k2 + dot( ss, k3 );
    if( thx < 0.0 ) { continue; } // behind
    float thy = clamp( -rd.x * thx, k4, k6 );
    sh = min( sh, dot2( vec3( thy, k5 - k7 * ss ) + rd * thx ) / ( thx * thx ) );
  }
  return sh;
}

// https://iquilezles.org/articles/boxfunctions/
// https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WslGz4
float boxSoftShadow
( 
  in vec3 ro, 
  in vec3 rd,
  in vec3 rad,   // box semi-size
  in float sk  
) 
{
  vec3 m = 1.0 / rd;
  vec3 n = m * ro;
  vec3 k = abs( m ) * rad;
  vec3 t1 = -n - k;
  vec3 t2 = -n + k;

  float tN = max( max( t1.x, t1.y ), t1.z );
  float tF = min( min( t2.x, t2.y ), t2.z );

  if( tN > tF || tF < 0.0 )
  {
    float sh = 1.0;
    sh = segShadow( ro.xyz, rd.xyz, rad.xyz, sh );
    sh = segShadow( ro.yzx, rd.yzx, rad.yzx, sh );
    sh = segShadow( ro.zxy, rd.zxy, rad.zxy, sh );
    return smoothstep( 0.0, 1.0, sk * sqrt( sh ) );
  }
  return 0.0;
}
```

Then we use them in a `draw_background` function, right before the smoothing of the plane:
```glsl
// New
float shad = boxSoftShadow
( 
  plane_hit, 
  normalize( LIGHT_SOURCE - plane_hit ), 
  BOX_DIMENSIONS, 
  2.0 
);
plane_color *= smoothstep( -0.2, 1.0, shad );

final_color = mix
( 
  plane_color, 
  final_color, 
  smoothstep
  ( 
    blur_radius - 1.5,
    blur_radius,
    length( uv )
  ) 
);
```
The result:

### Box surface

For the box's surface I'm going to use water noise from [Seascape Shader]. Just copy and paste function we are going to use. I renamed the in the following manner:
- `sea_octave` -> `water_octave`
- `map` -> `water_noise`
- `noise` -> `perlin_noise2dx1d` ( because it's [Perlin Noise], that takes 2d vector as input and returns a number, or 1d vector )
- `hash` -> `hash2dx1d`

```glsl
float hash2dx1d( in vec2 p ) 
{
	float h = dot( p, vec2( 127.1,311.7 ) );	
  return fract( sin( h ) * 43758.5453123 );
}

float perlin_noise2dx1d( in vec2 p )
{
  vec2 i = floor( p );
  vec2 f = fract( p );	
	vec2 u = smoothstep( vec2( 0.0 ), vec2( 1.0 ), f );

  float noise = mix( mix( hash2dx1d( i + vec2( 0.0,0.0 ) ), 
                          hash2dx1d( i + vec2( 1.0,0.0 ) ), u.x ),
                     mix( hash2dx1d( i + vec2( 0.0,1.0 ) ), 
                          hash2dx1d( i + vec2( 1.0,1.0 ) ), u.x ), u.y );

  return noise * 2.0 - 1.0;
}

float water_octave( in vec2 uv_in, in float choppy )
{
  // Offset the uv value in y = x direction by the noise value
  vec2 uv = uv_in + perlin_noise2dx1d( uv_in );
  vec2 s_wave = 1.0 - abs( sin( uv ) );
  vec2 c_wave = abs( cos( uv ) );
  // Smooth out the waves
  s_wave = mix( s_wave, c_wave, s_wave );
  // Shuffle the resulting values, I guess
  // Minus from 1.0 - for the wave to cave in
  return pow( 1.0 - pow( s_wave.x * s_wave.y, 0.65 ), choppy );
}

// Fbm based sea noise
float water_noise( in vec2 p )
{
  float freq = 0.16;
  float amp = 0.6;
  float choppy = 4.0;
  mat2 octave_m = mat2( 1.6, 1.2, -1.2, 1.6 );

  p.x *= 0.75;
  
  float d = 0.0;
  float h = 0.0;    

  for( int i = 0; i < 5; i++ ) 
  { 
    // Mix two octaves for better detail
    d = water_octave( ( p + iTime / 2.0 ) * freq, choppy ) + water_octave( ( p - iTime / 2.0 ) * freq, choppy );
    // Add the height of the current octave to the sum
    h += d * amp;        
    // Deform p domain( rotate and stretch)
    p *= octave_m; 
    freq *= 1.9; 
    amp *= 0.22;
    choppy = mix( choppy, 1.0, 0.2 );
  }

  return h;
}
```

The `water_noise` returns just the height, and not the difference like in the original. Other than that, the function are almost identical.
`hash2dx1d` function takes 2d vector and encodes it in 1d value, as if hashing the vector.

The noise above uses two technique: [Fractional Brownian Motion] and [Domain warping].  
With FBM you apply the same noise several times, by increasing the frequency and decreasing the amplitute at each iteration. This way you can add smaller details to your noise.
And with domain warping, you just deform your space in any way you like: move, rotate, scale, apply some function, apply some noise.

From the above example, for the water noise, the coordinates are first shifted by `perlin_noise2dx1d( uv )`, then transformed by `sin` and `cos` functions, smoothed using `smoothstep` and the result of previous deformation, and then raised to the power, while shuffling the values to get the final result.  There are no rules as to what is the right way to deform, it is your freedom to deform it any way you like.  
Lasly the noise is sampled and combined at different frequencies with different amplitudes to get the final result.

Links:
- [Perlin Noise]
- [Understanding Perlin Noise]
- [Fractional Brownian Motion]
- [Domain warping]

For our task, we need to caclulate the normal at the current position from the noise. The noise takes XZ coordinates, returning a number, that we will treat as a Y coordinates, making our noise a sort of height map.  
Taking a derivative in Z direction df/dz gives us a slope in that direction. Putting it into a vector ( 0.0, df/dz, 1.0 ) gives us the direction of the change in Z direction. Doing the same for X - ( 1.0, df/dx, 0.0 ), we get to perpendicular to each other vectors, whose cross product ( -dfdx, 1.0, -dfdz ) will give us the normal at that position.  
Maybe a video from Inigo Quilez will explain it better [Painting a Landscape with Maths]

In code it is implemented as follows:
```glsl
const float WATER_INTENSITY = 0.5;

// ...

vec3 water_normal( in vec2 p )
{
  float e = 0.01;
  vec2 offset = vec2( 1.0, 0.0 ) * e;
  float dfdx = ( water_noise( p + offset.xy ) - water_noise( p - offset.xy ) );
  float dfdz = ( water_noise( p + offset.yx ) - water_noise( p - offset.yx ) );
  vec3 normal = normalize( vec3( -dfdx, e / WATER_INTENSITY, -dfdz ) );
  return normal;
}
```
By increasing `WATER_INTENSITY`, you will decrease the Y component's influence, and hence increase the deviation from the `up` direction of the normal( as if increasing size of the waves ). `e` parameter is the small change in X or Z direction.

The normals were calculated in their local space, where Y points up, X and Z point forward and to the right - a so called tangent space. To put these normals on the box's faces we need to do what is called [Normal Mapping] - transformation from the tangent space, to a different coordinate space, which is build around the surface normal of the object( which in concept is very similiar to what we did with view rays in the beginning );

So first we need to get orthonormal unit vectors that describe the normal at each of the box's faces. In the main function. Since we deal with an axis aligned box, the normals are always parallel to one of the axis, so we can deal with all cases in a single equation shown below:
```glsl
if( box_t > 0.0 )
{
  // ...
  vec3 w = box_normal;
  vec3 u = normalize( M.xyy * w.z - M.yyx * w.x - M.yyx * w.y );
  vec3 v = normalize( M.yxy * w.z + M.yxy * w.x - M.xyy * w.y );
  mat3 TBN = mat3( u, w, v );
  // ...
}
```

For the water noise we need 2d vector, which we are going to get from the hit point position on the box. If the face is perpendicular to the Z axis, then we will use XY coordinates. If it is perpendicular to the Y axis - XZ, and so on:

```glsl
const float INSIDES_NOISE = 0.3

vec2 uv = ro.xy * w.z + ro.xz * w.y + ro.yz * w.x;
uv *= INSIDES_NOISE
```

I added the `INSIDES_NOISE` constant to easily control the detail in noise.  
Now we get our normal and transform it using our `TBN` matrix:

```glsl
vec3 n = normalize( TBN * water_normal( uv ) );
```

Links:
- [Painting a Landscape with Maths]
- [Normal Mapping]

Using the normal we can calculate the refracted and reflected rays, using builtin function. To calculate the refracted ray, we need to know the [Refractive Index] if both mediums

```glsl
const float airRI = 1.0;
// Refractive index of the box( water )
const float boxRI = 1.33;
// Index of refraction Air to Box
const float iorAtoB = airRI / boxRI;
// Index of refraction Box to Air
const float iorBtoA = boxRI / airRI;

// ...
if( box_t > 0.0 )
{
  // ...

  vec3 refractedRD = refract( rd, n, iorAtoB );
  vec3 reflectedRD = normalize( reflect( rd, n ) );
  
  // ...
}
```

Links:
- [Refractive Index]
- [List of refractive indices]

Before we go further, we also need to calculate the Freshel. It will tell us how much light is reflected `F` and how much is refracted `1.0 - F`. You can learn more about it here:
- [PBR Theory]
- [Computer Graphics Tutorial - PBR]
- [Microfacet BRDF]

```glsl
const float CRITICAL_ANGLE_ATOB = sqrt( max( 0.0, 1.0 - iorBtoA * iorBtoA ) );
const float CRITICAL_ANGLE_BTOA = sqrt( max( 0.0, 1.0 - iorAtoB * iorAtoB ) );
// ...

if( box_t > 0.0 )
{
  // ...
  vec3 F = fresnel( prev_rd, n, F0, CRITICAL_ANGLE_BTOA ); // New
  vec3 refractedRD = refract( rd, n, iorAtoB );
  vec3 reflectedRD = normalize( reflect( rd, n ) );
  
  // ...
}
```
`CRITICAL_ANGLE_...` is the angle, at which happens full reflection. can be calculation from [Refractive Index] of both mediums.  

For the refracted ray, we are goind to define a new function `draw_insides` that will handle the contents of the box, and for the reflected ray we simple call the `draw_background` function with the new ray direction. Both colors we then multiply be the fresnel.

```glsl
if( box_t > 0.0 )
{
  // If any refraction happens
  if( length( refractedRD ) > 0.0 )
  {
    refractedRD = normalize( refractedRD );
    vec3 insides_color = draw_insides( ro, refractedRD );
    final_color += ( 1.0 - F ) * insides_color;
  }

  vec3 refl_color = draw_background( ro, reflectedRD );
  final_color += F * refl_color;
}
```
If `draw_insides` return black, then we will get the following image:

### Box indsides

For the insides, we will go with the cosmic theme. So first we are goint to draw some stars.

#### Stars
We are going to draw stars on the sphere that is very far away. For this we will use are ray direction vector to get the `phi` and `theta` angles of the sperical coordinates. Then we will normalize and shift them to get `uv` coordinates in range from 0.0 to 1.0;

```glsl
vec3 draw_stars( in vec3 rd_in )
{
  vec3 final_color = vec3( 0.0 );

  float phi = atan( rd_in.x, rd_in.z );
  float theta = asin( rd_in.y );

  // [ 1/2PI, 1/PI ]
  vec2 normalization = vec2( 0.1591, 0.3183 );
  vec2 uv = vec2( phi, theta ) * normalization + vec2( 0.5 );

  // ...
}
```
Here `atan` function returns an angle in range [ -PI, PI ], whose tangent = `x / z`. `asin` returns an angle in range [ -PI/2, PI/2 ], whose sin equals `y`.  
Then we devide `phi` by `2PI` and `theta` by `PI`, to get the range [ -0.5, 0.5 ], that we then shift by 0.5, to finally get the `uv` coordinates in range [ 0.0, 1.0 ].  

Now we are going to devide our `uv` space into a grid, pick a random position inside the grid, shift it towards the middle, to make sure the star is fully inside to be drawn, and finally draw the star.  
This process will be repeated several times, each time increasing the size of the grid( and consequently decreasing the size of the cell ) and the size of the stars, to make them look more chaotic. Here's our code for the latter part:
```glsl
vec3 draw_stars( in vec3 rd_in )
{
  vec3 final_color = vec3( 0.0 );

  float phi = atan( rd_in.x, rd_in.z );
  float theta = asin( rd_in.y );

  // [ 1/2PI, 1/PI ]
  vec2 normalization = vec2( 0.1591, 0.3183 );
  vec2 uv = vec2( phi, theta ) * normalization + vec2( 0.5 );
  float grid_size = 10.0;
  float star_size = 0.07;
  float ray_width = 0.005;
  vec3 star_color = vec3( 1.0 );

  float star_size_change = 0.9;
  float grid_size_change = 1.6;

  // Big start are animated
  for( int i = 0; i < 3; i++ )
  {
    final_color += generate_stars( uv, grid_size, star_size, ray_width, true );
    star_size *= star_size_change;
    grid_size *= grid_size_change;
  }

  star_size *= 0.8;

  // Small stars are not animated
  for( int i = 3; i < 6; i++ )
  {
    final_color += generate_stars( uv, grid_size, star_size, ray_width, false );
    star_size *= star_size_change;
    grid_size *= grid_size_change;
  }

  return final_color;
}
```

Inside the `generate_stars` function, we multiply `uv` coordinates by the grid size, and treat its whole part as `cell_id` and fractional part as `uv` coordinates within the cell:

```glsl
vec3 generate_stars
(
  in vec2 uv,
  in float grid_size,
  in float star_size,
  in float flares_width,
  in bool twinkle
)
{
  uv *= grid_size;
  vec2 cell_id = floor( uv );
  vec2 cell_coords = fract( uv ) - 0.5;
  vec2 star_coords = hash2dx2d( cell_id ) - 0.5;
  star_coords -= sign( star_coords ) * max( vec2( star_size ) - vec2( 0.5 ) - abs( star_coords ), vec2( 0.0 ) );

  // ...
}
```

We shift cell coordinates by 0.5, to center them at 0.0. We get the position of the star by hashing cell's id( mapping a 2d vector to another 2d vector in range [ 0.0, 1.0 ] ).

Here we have some parameters, all are handpicked. Overall we have 6 iterations. They are devided into 2 parts, because bigger stars( first loop ) will have an animation, while smaller stars( smaller loop ) will not.  
After each iteration, decrease the size of the start by `star_size_change` and increase the size of the grid by `grid_size_change`. `star_coords` needs to  be moved to make sure that the bounding box of the star is fully insdie the current grid cell size.

The star's glow we will shape using an exponent that will depend on the distance to the center of the cell:

```glsl
vec2 delta_coords = abs( star_coords - cell_coords );
// Distance to the star from the cell coordinates
float dist = length( delta_coords );
vec3 glow = vec3( exp( -5.0 * length( dist ) / ( star_size * 2.0 ) ) );
```

We will randomize the star's brightness based on its cell id. The value that we get from the hash we remap to the range [ 0.5, 1.0 ]:

```glsl
float brightness = remap( 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, hash2dx1d( uv + vec2( 404.045, -123.423) ) );
```

Lastly, as mentioned above, we have big stars that need to be animated. If `twinkle` is `true`, then we are going to add animated [Lens flare]s to the star.

```glsl
if( twinkle )
{
  float twinkle_change = remap( -1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, sin( iTime * 3.0 + uv.x * uv.y ) );
  float flares = 
  smoothstep( flares_width, 0.0, delta_coords.x ) * smoothstep( star_size * twinkle_change, 0.0, dist ) +
  smoothstep( flares_width, 0.0, delta_coords.y ) * smoothstep( star_size * twinkle_change, 0.0, dist );
  
  glow = glow * flares;
}
```

The flares can be created by combining the smoothstep in `x` and `y` directions of our `uv` coordinates. For the vertical flare, `x` defines its width and and `y` defines its height. Same with horizontal flare, but inverse.

In the end we get this result:

#### Nebula
I took the code for Nebula from this [Supernova remnant Shader] and the colors from [Helix nebula Shader]. We just copy the code we need and adapt it for our task.  

First some utilities functions:
```glsl
vec2 raytrace_sphere( in vec3 ro, in vec3 rd, in vec3 ce, in float ra )
{
  vec3 oc = ro - ce;
  float b = dot( oc, rd );
  float c = dot( oc, oc ) - ra * ra;
  float h = b * b - c;
  if( h < 0.0 ) { return vec2( -1.0 ); } // no intersection
  h = sqrt( h );
  return vec2( -b - h, -b + h );
}

float length2( in vec2 p )
{
	return sqrt( p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y );
}

float length8( in vec2 p )
{
	p = p * p; 
  p = p * p; 
  p = p * p;
	return pow( p.x + p.y, 1.0 / 8.0 );
}
```
`raytrace_sphere` finds an intersection of a ray with a sphere.  

Then we take the noise functions:

```glsl
float disk( in vec3 p, in vec3 t )
{
  vec2 q = vec2( length2( p.xy ) - t.x, p.z * 0.5 );
  return max( length8( q ) - t.y, abs( p.z ) - t.z );
}

float spiral_noise( in vec3 p )
{
  float n = 0.0;	// noise amount
  float iter = 2.0;
  float nudge = 0.9; // size of perpendicular vector
  float normalizer = 1.0 / sqrt( 1.0 + nudge * nudge ); // pythagorean theorem on that perpendicular to maintain scale
  for( int i = 0; i < 8; i++ )
  {
    // add sin and cos scaled inverse with the frequency
    n += -abs( sin( p.y * iter ) + cos( p.x * iter ) ) / iter;	// abs for a ridged look
    // rotate by adding perpendicular and scaling down
    p += vec3( vec2( p.y, -p.x ) * nudge, 0.0 );
    p *= vec3( normalizer, normalizer, 1.0 );
    // rotate on other axis
    vec2 tmp = vec2( p.z, -p.x ) * nudge;
    p += vec3( tmp.x, 0.0, tmp.y );
    p *= vec3( normalizer, 1.0, normalizer );
    // increase the frequency
    iter *= 1.733733;
  }
  return n;
}

float nebula_noise( in vec3 p )
{
  float result = disk( p.xzy, vec3( 2.0, 1.8, 1.25 ) );
  result += spiral_noise( p.zxy * 0.5123 + 100.0 ) * 3.0;
  return result;
}
```

Again, the noise uses a combination of FBM and Domain warp techniques. Worth noting that the final noise is pushed away by the `disk` function, that return disk shaped figure like this:

To draw the Nebula, a technique called [Ray marching]. For more look here
- [Coding Adventure: Ray Marching]
- [An introduction to Raymarching]

First we setup some state:

```glsl
vec3 draw_nebula( in vec3 ro, in vec3 rd )
{
  // Redius of the sphere that envelops the nebula
  float radius = 6.0;
  // Max density
  float h = 0.1;
  float optimal_radius = 3.0;
  float k = optimal_radius / radius;

  vec3 p;
  vec4 final_color = vec4( 0.0 );
  float local_density = 0.0;
  float total_density = 0.0;
  float weight = 0.0;

  // ...
}
```
`optimal_radius` is the radius I've found to be the best looking with other parameters defaulting to the original shader. `k` is scaler, that we will use to be able to change the size of the nebula easily.

```glsl
// ...
vec2 vt = raytrace_sphere( ro, rd, vec3( 0.0 ), radius );
// Itersection point when entering the sphere
float tin = vt.x;
// Intersection point when exiting the sphere
float tout = vt.y;
float t = max( tin, 0.0 );

// If sphere was hit
if( any( notEqual( vt, vec2( -1.0 ) ) ) )
{
  // ...
}
```

The nebula is contained withing a sphere, so we first check if the ray intersects the sphere.

```glsl
for( var i = 0; i < 64; i++ )
{
  if total_density > 0.9 || t > tout { break; }

  // Current posiiton inside the sphere
  p = ro + t * rd;
  p *= k;
  // By feeding the 3d position we turn 3d domain into a 3d texture of densities
  // So we get the density at the current position
  let d = abs( nebula_noise( p * 3.0 ) * 0.5 ) + 0.07;

  // Distance to the light soure
  var ls_dst = max( length( p ), 0.001 ); 

  // The color of light 
  // https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cdK3Wy
  let _T = ls_dst * 2.3 + 2.6;
  var light_color = 0.4 + 0.5 * cos( _T + PI * 0.5 * vec3( -0.5, 0.15, 0.5 ) );
  final_color += vec4f( vec3f( 0.67, 0.75, 1.0 ) / ( ls_dst * ls_dst * 10.0 ) / 80.0, 0.0 ); // star itself
  final_color += vec4f( light_color / exp( ls_dst * ls_dst * ls_dst * 0.08 ) / 30.0, 0.0 ); // bloom

  // ...

}
```

And the main raymarching loop begins. We make a step forward, sample noise( with some modifications ), get the length to the light source( the star at the center), and draw the star with a bloom effect it creates. The colors are scaled greatly because they will be added at each iteration of the loop.

```glsl
if( d < h )
{
  // Compute local density 
  local_density = h - d;
  // Compute weighting factor. The more density accumulated so far, the less weigth current local density has
  weight = ( 1.0 - total_density ) * local_density;
  // Accumulate density
  total_density += weight + 1.0 / 200.0;
  
  // Transparancy falls, as the density increases
  vec4 col = vec4( nebula_color( total_density, ls_dst ), total_density );

  // Emission. The densier the medium gets, the brighter it shines
  final_color += final_color.a * vec4( final_color.rgb, 0.0 ) * 0.2;	   
  // Uniform scale density
  col.a *= 0.2;
  // Color by alpha
  col.rgb *= col.a;
  // Alpha blend in contribution
  final_color = final_color + col * ( 1.0 - final_color.a );
}
```

Then we draw the Nebula's surroundings. If the density at the current point is less than a threshold - we do the calculations for the color. The color's opacity at the current position depends on the `total_density` meaning that the more dense the medium gets - the more opaque it becomes.

```glsl
total_density += 1.0 / 70.0;
// Optimize step size near the camera and near the light source. The densier field - the bigger step
t += max( d * 0.1 * max( min( ls_dst, length( ro * k ) ), 1.0 ), 0.01 ) / k;
```

As a final step we adjust the `t` to move forwrard, based on the local density and the closeness to the camera and light source.

```glsl
// Simple scattering
final_color *= 1.0 / exp( total_density * 0.2 ) * 0.8;

return smoothstep( vec3( 0.0 ), vec3( 1.0 ), final_color.rgb );
```

Once the raymarching pass is done, scattering is applied and the color is smoothed.

### Inside reflections

Finally we need to add some reflections isndie the box. The process is the same as when we did refractions and reflections from the outsize.

```glsl
const int NUM_REFLECTIONS = 2;

// ...

vec3 draw_insides
(
  in vec3 ro,
  in vec3 rd
)
{
  float distance_traveled = 1.0;
  vec3 final_color = vec3( 0.0 );
  vec3 prev_ro = ro;
  vec3 prev_rd = rd;
  vec3 attenuation = vec3( 1.0 );

  // ...
  for( int i = 0; i < NUM_REFLECTIONS; i++ )
  {
    // ...
  }
}
```

We setup some state. Since we are going to do several reflections, we need a variable that we can update at the end of each iteration.

```glsl
for( int i = 0; i < NUM_REFLECTIONS; i++ )
{
  vec3 inside_color = draw_box_background( prev_ro * INNER_BOX_SCALE, prev_rd );
  final_color += inside_color * attenuation;

  // ...
}

```
We first draw are Nebula and stars. The position is multiplied by the `INNER_BOX_SCALE` to make the box bigger when we draw the insides.

```glsl
for( int i = 0; i < NUM_REFLECTIONS; i++ )
{
  // ...

  vec3 box_normal;
  float box_t = raytrace_box( prev_ro, prev_rd, box_normal, BOX_DIMENSIONS, false );

  vec3 new_ro = prev_ro + box_t * prev_rd;
  distance_traveled += length( prev_ro - new_ro );

  // ...
}
```

Then we find the intersection with the next face of the box.

```glsl
for( int i = 0; i < NUM_REFLECTIONS; i++ )
{
  // ...

  vec3 w = box_normal;
  vec3 u = M.xyy * w.z - M.yyx * w.x - M.yyx * w.y;
  vec3 v = M.yxy * w.z + M.yxy * w.x - M.xyy * w.y;
  mat3 TBN = mat3( u, w, v );

  vec2 uv = new_ro.xy * w.z + new_ro.xz * w.y + new_ro.yz * w.x;
  uv *= INSIDES_NOISE;

  vec3 n = TBN * water_normal( uv );

  // ...
}
```
Do the usual normal mapping with sampling form the water noise.

```glsl
for( int i = 0; i < NUM_REFLECTIONS; i++ )
{
  // ...

  vec3 F = fresnel( prev_rd, n, F0, CRITICAL_ANGLE_BTOA );
  vec3 reflectedRD = normalize( reflect( prev_rd, -n ) );
  vec3 refractedRD = refract( prev_rd, -n , iorBtoA );

  // ...
}
```

Calculate Fresnel and new rays. If we want to make the box transparent, we can cacluate the background color from the reflected ray and add it to the final color.

```glsl
for( int i = 0; i < NUM_REFLECTIONS; i++ )
{
  // ...

  // Makes the box transparent
  #ifdef TRANSPARENT_BOX
    if( length( refractedRD ) > 0.0 )
    {
      vec3 refractedRD = normalize( refractedRD );
      vec3 F = fresnel( refractedRD, n, F0, CRITICAL_ANGLE_ATOB );
      vec3 background_color = draw_background( new_ro, refractedRD, LIGHT_SOURCE );
      final_color += ( 1.0 - F ) * background_color * exp( -distance_traveled * 1.0 * vec3( 1.0 - COLOR_ABSORPTION ) ) * attenuation;
    }

    float edge_t = smooth_box_edge( new_ro );
    vec3 edge_color =  mix( final_color, BOX_EDGE_COLOR, edge_t );
    final_color = mix( final_color, edge_color, smoothstep(  0.0,  1.0, exp( -distance_traveled / 3.0 ) ) );
  #endif

  // ...
}
```
You can see that we recalculate the Fresnel for the incoming light from the outside and additionally attenuate light based on the distance traveled. We also should not forget about our opaque black edges that should be visible in the reflection.

```glsl
for( int i = 0; i < NUM_REFLECTIONS; i++ )
{
  // ...

  attenuation *= F;
  prev_ro = new_ro;
  prev_rd = reflectedRD;
}
```

Finally we update the state and end the iteration. Resulting color is return and we get our final render:
